# Predicting-Flight-Cancellation-A-Machine-Learning-Approach

## Overview
This project aims to predict flight cancellations using machine learning techniques, leveraging historical flight data from 2009 to 2018. By analyzing key factors such as airline operations, weather conditions, and scheduling patterns, we develop predictive models to assist airlines in proactive decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes flight details such as departure times, cancellation reasons, weather conditions, and airline information. After preprocessing, the dataset contains over 12 million records with key features selected through exploratory data analysis.

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends in flight cancellations.
Model Development: Implementing and evaluating K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest models.
Performance Evaluation: Comparing accuracy and recall scores to determine the best-performing model.

## Results
The Random Forest model outperformed KNN, achieving higher accuracy and recall. Key factors influencing cancellations include the month of travel and airline-specific patterns.

## Impact
This project provides actionable insights for airline operators to reduce cancellations, optimize resources, enhance customer service, and minimize operational disruptions.
